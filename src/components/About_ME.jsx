        The Foundation: Growing Up Across India
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Moving across cities and studying in Air Force Schools in Pune, Agra,
        Srinagar, and Jamnagar shaped my ability to adapt. Each transition
        brought new cultures, people, and experiences, fostering resilience and
        a deep appreciation for change. This adaptability became a cornerstone
        of my academic and professional journey, helping me embrace challenges
        with confidence and curiosity.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">The Leap to IIT Jodhpur</h2>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Cracking JEE was just the beginning. Entering IIT Jodhpur as a B.Tech
        student in Chemical Engineering, I was eager to explore how theoretical
        concepts translate into real-world applications. Engineering, for me, is
        more than just equations and simulations; it’s about solving tangible
        problems and pushing the boundaries of innovation.

        A Dive into Machine Learning
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        One of the defining moments in my journey was being selected for the
        Amazon ML Summer School. This experience unlocked a deeper understanding
        of advanced AI techniques like reinforcement learning and generative
        models. The structured curriculum and hands-on applications sharpened my
        problem-solving skills and solidified my interest in AI-driven
        solutions.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
        Bridging AI and Process Control
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Fueled by my curiosity, I embarked on a project integrating Model
        Predictive Control (MPC) with Reinforcement Learning. Implementing
        Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for handling
        continuous action spaces was a game-changer. This project reinforced my
        ability to think critically and optimize complex, dynamic systems.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
        Merging Passion with Technology: The Formula 1 Project
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Beyond academics, I found a unique way to blend my love for Formula 1
        and software development. I began developing a full-stack website for
        the Formula 1 Club at IIT Jodhpur. The goal? To create an immersive
        experience with real-time race updates, live commentary, and an
        interactive chat system. By leveraging ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and
        WebRTC, I aimed to provide a seamless platform for fellow enthusiasts.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">
        Looking Ahead: The Future of Innovation
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Each project, challenge, and success has shaped my perspective on
        engineering and technology. Whether it’s optimizing industrial processes
        with AI or crafting engaging digital experiences, my focus remains on
        bridging the gap between theory and application. True learning happens
        when we step outside our comfort zones and tackle problems head-on.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mt-2 text-gray-700">
        As I move forward, I am eager to contribute, learn, and innovate.
        Whether through research, development, or tech-driven solutions, I aim
        to make a meaningful impact. This journey is far from over—it's just
        getting started.
