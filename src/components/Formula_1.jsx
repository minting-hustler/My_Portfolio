          The Ultimate Formula 1 Club Website: A Full-Stack Development Journey

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a website designed not just to provide Formula 1 enthusiasts with race schedules and standings but to fully immerse them in the world of high-speed racing. A platform where fans can watch live races, engage in real-time discussions, and filter statistics dynamically based on personal preferences. This is the vision behind the Formula 1 Club Website, a full-stack web application developed using ReactJS, MongoDB, and NodeJS.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Motivation: Addressing the Needs of Formula 1 Enthusiasts</h2>
        <p>
          Formula 1 fans have long struggled with scattered sources of information—some websites provide race schedules, others showcase team statistics, and a few offer live discussions, but there is no one-stop solution for everything F1. This project aims to bridge that gap by delivering a centralized platform that offers live race tracking, real-time chat, and advanced filtering options, all wrapped in a sleek, intuitive, and high-performance interface.
